# BetterOBS
This is where you can find all of things i used to build BetterOBS.

All of this plugins and themes are installed on OBS.live from streamelements, i changed the default theme to Twitchy.
I colorized the default OBS Color to red.
I'll allways update the plugins and the OBS as a one single package and with automatic updates disabled to avoid breaking the OBS Studio.
I'll only update OBS Studio and alll the plugins when their versions are compatible.

I'll add new themes when get good themes.
